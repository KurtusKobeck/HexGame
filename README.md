Generic Hexagonal Board Game Simulation Enviroment (GHBGSE)
#
This is an educational tool meant to create an environment for creating NPC agents to play a Generic Hexagonal board game. I've made algorithmic NPCs who can play out such a game and am working on turning this into a useful environment for testing NPC algorithms against one another to determine optimal strategies. I'm interested in using pytorch to pit machine learning NPC agents against each other to see if any unforeseen strategies or optimized play patterns emerge at a later date.
